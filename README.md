Requirements
- your miniRT executable is actually called `miniRT`, as it should be :P

Instructions
1. `cd miniRT` (or whatever your project directory is called)
2. `git clone https://github.com/magalifabri/miniRT-tester.git`
3. `cd miniRT-tester`
4. `./tester.sh`
    - `tester.sh -v` runs the tests with valgrind, creating a long ass compilation of the valgrind reports for you to work through :P
